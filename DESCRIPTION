Description: Import, create, edit and export family tree GEDCOM files.
    Genealogical Data Communication (GEDCOM) is a flat text file 
    format which contains many nested data structures representing 
    genealogical records. This package automates away the complexity in 
    constructing these files, representing them as S7 objects.
