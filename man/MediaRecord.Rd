\arguments{
\item{confidential}{A logical value indicating whether the associated record/fact should be
treated as confidential. This allows them to be excluded on export.}

\item{locked}{A logical value indicating whether the associated record/fact should be
treated as read-only.}

\item{private}{A logical value indicating whether the associated record/fact should be
treated as private. This allows them to be excluded on export.}

\item{user_ids}{A character vector of user-generated identifiers. The type of the identifiers can
be given in the vector names, e.g. c("Driving license number" = "ABC123")}

\item{unique_ids}{A character vector of enduring and globally-unique identifiers. These need
to be formatted in line with RFC 4122 and can be generated with \code{uuid::UUIDgenerate()}.}

\item{ext_ids}{A named character vector of identifiers maintained by an external authority.
The names must be given as a URI. See the GEDCOM specification for more information.}

\item{note_xrefs}{A character vector of relevant note record cross-reference identifiers.}

\item{notes}{Associated notes. This can either be a \code{Note()} object, a list of them,
or a character vector of notes.}

\item{citations}{Associated sources. This can either be a \code{SourceCitation()} object, a list of them,
or a character vector of XREFs of source records.}

\item{media_links}{Not used.}

\item{created}{A \code{CreationDate()} object containing the date the record was created.
Creating an object with no parameters sets the date to today.}

\item{updated}{A \code{ChangeDate()} object containing the date the record was updated.
Creating an object with no parameters sets the date to today.}

\item{files}{A \code{MediaFile} object or a list of them. This refers to 1 or more external
digital files. Grouped files should each pertain to the same context.}
}
