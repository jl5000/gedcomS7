Save a gedcom object to disk as a GEDCOM file
}
\details{
This function prepares the gedcom object and then writes it to the filepath.
Steps taken include filtering sensitive data, escaping "@" signs (with another "@") ,
and splitting long lines onto separate lines.

Writing to GEDzip files is not supported. If you want to do this then write
to a GEDCOM file first and then move the file to the GEDzip archive.
