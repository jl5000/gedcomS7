\arguments{
\item{XREF}{The cross-reference identifier for this record. You should not edit this at all
as maintenance of these is done automatically.}

\item{confidential}{A logical value indicating whether the associated record/fact should be
treated as confidential. This allows them to be excluded on export.}

\item{locked}{A logical value indicating whether the associated record/fact should be
treated as read-only.}

\item{private}{A logical value indicating whether the associated record/fact should be
treated as private. This allows them to be excluded on export.}

\item{user_ids}{A character vector of user-generated identifiers. The type of the identifiers can
be given in the vector names, e.g. c("Driving license number" = "ABC123")}

\item{unique_ids}{A character vector of enduring and globally-unique identifiers. These need
to be formatted in line with RFC 4122 and can be generated with \code{uuid::UUIDgenerate()}.}

\item{ext_ids}{A named character vector of identifiers maintained by an external authority.
The names must be given as a URI. See the GEDCOM specification for more information.}

\item{note_xrefs}{A character vector of relevant note record cross-reference identifiers.}

\item{notes}{Associated notes. This can either be a \code{Note()} object, a list of them,
or a character vector of notes.}

\item{citations}{Not used.}

\item{media_links}{Associated multimedia. This can either be a \code{MediaLink()} object, a list of them,
or a character vector of XREFs of multimedia records.}

\item{created}{A \code{CreationDate()} object containing the date the record was created.
Creating an object with no parameters sets the date to today.}

\item{updated}{A \code{ChangeDate()} object containing the date the record was updated.
Creating an object with no parameters sets the date to today.}

\item{facts_recorded}{The facts recorded by the source. This can either be a \code{FactsRecorded} object,
a list of them, or a character vector of comma-delimited fact types. For example, a parish register of
births, deaths, and marriages would be "BIRT, DEAT, MARR". The \code{val_fact_types()} function gives a
list of possible fact types.}

\item{agency}{The organization, institution, corporation, person, or other entity that
has responsibility for the associated fact. Examples are an employer of a person of an
associated occupation, or an educational establishment that has awarded a scholastic award.}

\item{data_note_xrefs}{A character vector of note record cross-reference identifiers relevant
to the source data.}

\item{data_notes}{Associated notes about the source data. This can either be a \code{Note}
object, a list of them, or a character vector of notes.}

\item{originator}{The person, agency, or entity who created the record. For a published work,
this could be the author, compiler, transcriber, abstractor, or editor. For an unpublished
source, this may be an individual, a government agency, church organization, or private organization.}

\item{full_title}{The full title of the source.}

\item{short_title}{A shortened name of the source used for sorting, filing, and retrieving records.}

\item{publication_facts}{When and where the record was created. For published works, this
includes information such as the city of publication, name of the publisher, and year of publication.}

\item{source_text}{A verbatim copy of any description contained within the source. This can
either be a \code{TranslationText()} object, a list of them, or a character vector of text.}

\item{repo_citations}{Associated repositories. This can either be a \code{RepositoryCitation} object,
a list of them, or a character vector of XREFs of repository records.}
