The goal of `gedcomS7` is to handle genealogical data as GEDCOM files.
This package succeeds the `tidyged` package and many of the other
packages in the `gedcompendium`. The key changes are:

- The package is designed to work with GEDCOM 7.0, rather than 5.5.5.
- The package has minimal dependencies; currently only one:
  [`S7`](https://rconsortium.github.io/S7/).
- GEDCOM files are stored as S7 objects rather than dataframes.
- The package contains all functionality to create, edit, and
  interrogate GEDCOM files.

## Installation

You can install the development version of gedcomS7 from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("jl5000/gedcomS7")
```

## Key limitations

When importing existing GEDCOM files, you should ensure that they are
error free. This package assumes imported GEDCOM files are valid and
very few validation checks are carried out. Several GEDCOM validators
are available, including an online validator at
<https://ged-inline.org/>.

The package does not currently support extension tags. If you import a
file with these features, the package may behave unpredictably.

It can be quite cumbersome manipulating GEDCOM files using this package
at the command line. Ideally, the package would have a shiny app
interface, and this is a longer term aspiration.

## Example

GEDCOM files can be imported (with `read_gedcom()`) or created from
scratch, creating an S7 object representation:

``` r
library(gedcomS7)

ged <- new_gedcom()
ged
#> GEDCOM file summary:
#>  
#> GEDCOM version:     7.0
#> Creation Date:      2 MAY 2025
#> Default Language:   en
#> Source:             gedcomS7
#> Source name:        The 'gedcomS7' package for the R language
#> 
#> Copyright:          <Undefined>
#> 
#> Submitters:         0
#> Individuals:        0
#> Families:           0
#> Sources:            0
#> Repositories:       0
#> Multimedia:         0
#> Notes:              0
```

The metadata for the gedcom object (ged@…) can be modified.

``` r
ged@header@notes <- "This file contains my family tree"
ged@header@gedcom_copyright <- "Copyright Jamie Lendrum 2023"
ged
#> GEDCOM file summary:
#>  
#> GEDCOM version:     7.0
#> Creation Date:      2 MAY 2025
#> Default Language:   en
#> Source:             gedcomS7
#> Source name:        The 'gedcomS7' package for the R language
#> 
#> Copyright:          Copyright Jamie Lendrum 2023
#> 
#> Submitters:         0
#> Individuals:        0
#> Families:           0
#> Sources:            0
#> Repositories:       0
#> Multimedia:         0
#> Notes:              0
```

New records can be created and ‘pushed’ to the GEDCOM object:

``` r
subm_record <- SubmitterRecord(subm_name = "Jamie Lendrum")
indi_record <- IndividualRecord(sex = "M",
                                pers_names = PersonalName("Joe /Bloggs/"))
sour_record <- SourceRecord(full_title = "Census of England and Wales, 1921")

ged <- ged |> 
  push_record(subm_record) |> 
  push_record(indi_record) |> 
  push_record(sour_record)
#> New Submitter record added with xref @U1@
#> New Individual record added with xref @I1@
#> New Source record added with xref @S1@

ged@records
#> Submitters:         1
#> Individuals:        1
#> Families:           0
#> Sources:            1
#> Repositories:       0
#> Multimedia:         0
#> Notes:              0
```

Existing records, must be ‘pulled’ from the object, edited, and then
‘pushed’ back.

``` r
joe_bloggs <- pull_record(ged, "@I1@")
joe_bloggs@notes <- "He had a dog called Rover"
ged <- push_record(ged, joe_bloggs)
```

The entire GEDCOM representation can be seen with the `@GEDCOM`
property:

``` r
ged@GEDCOM
#>  [1] "0 HEAD"                                          
#>  [2] "1 GEDC"                                          
#>  [3] "2 VERS 7.0"                                      
#>  [4] "1 SOUR gedcomS7"                                 
#>  [5] "2 NAME The 'gedcomS7' package for the R language"
#>  [6] "2 CORP Jamie Lendrum"                            
#>  [7] "3 EMAIL jalendrum@gmail.com"                     
#>  [8] "1 DATE 2 MAY 2025"                               
#>  [9] "1 COPR Copyright Jamie Lendrum 2023"             
#> [10] "1 LANG en"                                       
#> [11] "1 NOTE This file contains my family tree"        
#> [12] "0 @U1@ SUBM"                                     
#> [13] "1 NAME Jamie Lendrum"                            
#> [14] "0 @I1@ INDI"                                     
#> [15] "1 NAME Joe /Bloggs/"                             
#> [16] "1 SEX M"                                         
#> [17] "1 NOTE He had a dog called Rover"                
#> [18] "0 @S1@ SOUR"                                     
#> [19] "1 TITL Census of England and Wales, 1921"        
#> [20] "0 TRLR"
```

The object can be exported to a GEDCOM file:

``` r
write_gedcom(ged, "my_gedcom.ged")
```
